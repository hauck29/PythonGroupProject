I've also photographed the king cobra, which is much bigger but is the sole member of its own genus. The forest cobra is a capable swimmer and is often considered to be semiaquatic. My team and I searched the lowland forests and wet savanna habitats for this beautiful species during an assignment in Cameroon, and eventually we got lucky. It's a fast snake, with a reputation for being alert and sometimes nervous. Bites to humans are less common than for other African cobras due to various factors, though a bite from the forest cobra is indeed a life-threatening emergency. Ironically the lethal characteristics of snake venom are what make it valuable and sought after for use in medicinal treatments. The toxic components of snake venom have led to the development of remedies for heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. With a bit of luck, the forest cobra also may soon combat heart disease, without affecting the wild populations of the species.

Vikings 1 and 2; the Pathfinder and Phoenix landers; Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity rovers have sent back sunrise and sunset scenes.

        Martian sunsets typically stand out for their distinctive blue color.

Exoplanets are defined as planets outside of our solar system. All other known exoplanets and exoplanet candidates have been found in the Milky Way, almost all of them less than about 3,000 light-years from Earth.

        This new result is based on transits, events in which the passage of a planet in front of a star blocks some of the star's light and produces a characteristic dip. Researchers used our @NASAChandraXray Observatory to search for dips in the brightness of X-rays received from X-ray bright binaries in the spiral galaxy Messier 51, also called the Whirlpool Galaxy (pictured here). These luminous systems typically contain a neutron star or black hole pulling in gas from a closely orbiting companion star. They estimate the exoplanet candidate would be roughly the size of Saturn, and orbit the neutron star or black hole at about twice the distance of Saturn from the Sun.

        Our robotic and human explorers are here to help. On Dec. 4, 2021, the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) spacecraft captured the Moon's shadow as it passed over Antarctica, home to penguins and a handful of scientists. Shaped like a cone extending into space, the shadow has a circular cross-section most easily seen during a solar eclipse. People in parts of Namibia, South Africa, New Zealand, and the Falkland Islands were treated to a partial eclipse.

        How about seeing it from another perspective? Astronaut Kayla Barron snapped images of the eclipse from inside the International Space Station (@ISS). Visible in the foreground is a Russian segment of the orbiting laboratory.

        A solar eclipse happens when the Moon moves between the Sun and Earth, casting a shadow on Earth, fully or partially blocking the Sun‚Äôs light in some areas. For a total solar eclipse to take place, the Sun, Moon, and Earth must line up exactly.

        A joint NASA-@NOAA observatory, DSCOVR orbits about a million miles from Earth and takes a new picture of Earth every two hours with its camera called EPIC ‚Äì the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera. Launched in 2009, DSCOVR monitors changes in the solar wind and provides space weather forecasts and alerts for solar storms that could temporarily disrupt power grids and GPS.
